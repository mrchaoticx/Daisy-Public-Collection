# Model 917
Originally released 1972, after its precursor the 917, the Daisy 880 would become the face of Pellet and BB gun pump Rifles. 
Marketed off the 917's "5 Shot Repeater" Campaign. The 880 had higher accuracy rifling and paved the way for BB guns and models to come.
The 880 used several parts from the 917 and other models (future tense..). The 880's (After 1995) piston can go into a 917's piston tube without problem.
Though possibly to save money on engineering, keeping most parts similar through the Daisy line allows for a lot of customization and cheap, abundant parts.
