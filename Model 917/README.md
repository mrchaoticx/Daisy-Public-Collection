# Model 917
Originally released in the early 1970's, Daisys 917 or "The first 5 Shot Repeater" is a pump air rifle similar to the Daisy 880. 
The 917 was the precursor to the 880 and remains interchangeable with many modern and old parts. 
The classic 917 Piston tube can have a modern 880's Piston put into it. 
Though possibly to save money on engineering, keeping most parts similar through the Daisy line allows for a lot of customization and cheap, abundant parts.
